# Daveds_Profile_Repo
This Project will serve as a template for a Portfolio where my future work will be stored.
As this is one of the first challenges, I do not have any examples of my work yet to be added.
As the course progesses, the portfolio should begin to fill up.
This challenge involed me creating basic html and css code to build this template
